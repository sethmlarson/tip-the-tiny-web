# Tip the Tiny Web

My journey to financially support all the digital content I enjoy without ads, tracking, or parasitic behavior. 

## How this works

You set a monthly budget that you'd like to distribute to creators you enjoy.
This budget is then distributed through a two-pool system.

The first pool tracks the outstanding balance for each creator over time.
This pool doesn't actually distribute any money, it's only there to help you
remember how much money you'd like to distribute to each creator.

The second pool is money that can be sent to creators as payments from the first pool.
This pool has stricter requirements, such as meeting a minimum threshold for a payment platform
or tier. This pool is cleared when you decide to pay a creator, and our service tries
to be helpful for making these payments quick and easy.
